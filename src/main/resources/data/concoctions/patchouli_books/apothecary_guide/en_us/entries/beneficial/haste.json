Mining Fatigue III inflicted by elder guardians prevents the player from instant mining most blocks regardless of the Haste effect, along with a huge decrease of mining speed.  However, lower levels of Mining Fatigue can be overcome by Haste of level III or greater, with a resultant reduced Haste effect.",
