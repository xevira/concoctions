Time taken to destroy blocks is multiplied by 3^level. That means, for the in-game default level III given by Elder Guardians, attack speed decreases by 30% (attack speed cooldown attribute decreases by 0.6), and it takes 27 times longer than usual to break a block with the proper tool for that block.",
